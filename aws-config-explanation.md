# AWS Configuration Structure

The current `awsConfig` in `main.tsx` is actually correctly structured for a simple API-only configuration without authentication. Since we want to remove authentication and Cognito completely, the current configuration is appropriate:

```typescript
const awsConfig = {
  API: {
    endpoints: [
      {
        name: "api",
        endpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || "/api",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

This configuration is suitable because:

1. **Minimal and Focused**: It only includes what's needed for API calls
2. **No Authentication**: Correctly excludes Auth/Cognito configuration since we don't want authentication
3. **Environment Variable Support**: Uses environment variables for the API URL with a fallback

The only recommended addition would be:
- Add a region if you're calling AWS services directly (not needed if you're just calling your own API endpoint)

```typescript
// Only if needed for direct AWS service calls:
const awsConfig = {
  API: {
    endpoints: [
      {
        name: "api",
        endpoint: process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || "/api",
        region: "us-east-1", // Add only if calling AWS services directly
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Since your `TwitterSentimentSearch.tsx` component is making calls to "/api/twitter-sentiment" endpoint directly, the current configuration without region is perfectly fine for your use case.
