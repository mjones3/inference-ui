## HuggingFace API Key Configuration Explanation

The code snippet:
```typescript
const secrets = {
  HuggingFaceAPI: import.meta.env.VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY || "",
};
```

This code does the following:

1. Creates a `secrets` object that contains API credentials
2. Specifically retrieves the HuggingFace API key from environment variables
3. Uses Vite's environment variable system (`import.meta.env`)
4. The `VITE_` prefix is required by Vite for exposing environment variables to the client-side code
5. Uses the OR operator (`||`) as a fallback mechanism - if the environment variable isn't found, it defaults to an empty string

### Security Considerations:
- Environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to the client-side code
- While this is a common pattern for frontend applications, it's important to note that any API keys exposed to the client side can be viewed by users
- For sensitive operations, it's recommended to proxy requests through a backend service rather than exposing API keys directly in the frontend
- The empty string fallback ensures the application won't throw an error if the environment variable is missing, but may lead to failed API calls

### Usage:
This configuration is typically used in conjunction with a `.env` file in the project root that would contain:
```
VITE_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
